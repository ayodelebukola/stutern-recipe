                    Beans is one of the earliest cultivated plants.
                    The oldest findings and proof that we used beans for foods are 9,000 years old and were found in Thailand.
                    Wild varieties of bread beans were gathered in Afghanistan and the Himalayan foothills.
                    Porridge beans is a common food in many Nigerian households and commonly referred to as 'Stewed Beans'.
                    In Yoruba, it is referred to as 'Ewa' or 'Ewa Agoyin'. 
                    It is a good dish for vegetarians and in contrast to the common misconceptions about beans being a full proteinaceous dish,
                    it actually has a higher percentage of carbohydrate and also consist of fibers, folate and iron. Some beans however have toxins while they are still raw.
                    Beans used to be very affordable and popular, everyone had access to it, making porridge beans a simple and easy to cook dish without the use of much ingredients. 
                    Beans porridge can be made in a variety of ways, usually as a filling, simple 'one-pot' recipe which elevates it to a remarkable status. 
                    Porridge beans goes perfectly with the sides: plantains, bread(Nigerian Agege), garri and yam, or whichever side dishes of your choice.
